SPELL: spellchecking library for Common Lisp.

License: BSD

Loading the SPELL system may initially take up to 20 seconds (on my machine) as
an English dictionary is loaded and compiled into the resulting FASL file.

For loading the full version:
> (ql:quickload :spell)

For loading the simple version:
> (ql:quickload :spell/simple)

Currently the only exported function is #'LOOKUP that accepts a string.

The difference between the full and the simple version is that the simple
version answers only "does this word occur in the English dictionary?" with
a boolean value, while the full version returns a list of all word meanings
associated with that string.
