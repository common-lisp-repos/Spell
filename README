SPELL: spellchecking library for Common Lisp.

License: BSD

Loading the SPELL system may initially take up to 20 seconds (on my machine) as
an English dictionary is loaded and compiled into the resulting FASL file.

For loading the full version:
> (ql:quickload :spell)

For loading the simple version:
> (ql:quickload :spell/simple)

The difference between the full and the simple version is that the simple
version answers only "does this word occur in the English dictionary?" with
a boolean value, while the full version returns a list of all word meanings
associated with that string.

Currently the only exported functions are #'ENGLISH-LOOKUP that accepts a
string, and #'ENGLISH-CHECK-PARAGRAPH that checks a whole paragraph of text and
returns a list of conses. Each cons represents a single word in the paragraph
which has failed dictionary lookup, with the CAR and CDR being offsets in the
original string outlining the word.
